  I've been using =os.fork()= the whole time,
  but what happens if I just use exec?
  
  What do the C examples look like?
  
** for file redirection.
   os.close(fd)?
   - os.close(0) for stdin
   - os.close(1) for stdout
     
   reopen the fd's with the new I/O
   
   Let's try =os.dup2(fd, fd2, inheritable=True)=
   - duplicate fd to fd2, closing the latter if first neccessary
